// RESTful Poetics

// I make imaginary buildings out of words
// I command machines to sing 
// My tool is a glowing box.
// My fingers invoke electric hammer to nails
// The command-line-interface is my journal 
// The applications are my pages. 

// My buildings sit atop mountains
// mostly buried beneath the cyber sea

// Surfers land on my website's beach
// and humbly make a GET request to data
// Hidden beneach the waves in the mountains database
